Embrace it.\\n\\nThe `unsafe` keyword in [TypeScript] is `any`.\\nWhile you should avoid using `any` in most cases,\\nit is often enough that your tool chain should not prevent or punish you from using it.\\n\\nYou might think,\\n\\n> \\"hey, I\'m working in a team and I don\'t want my team members who are less familiar with TypeScript to abuse the usage of `any`.\\"\\n\\nYes, that is a legit concern,\\nand you can make your own judgement for your circumstances.\\n\\nMy personal experience is that the number of times I have to break the rules are common enough that making exceptions for the tools (e.g. adding `// eslint ignore` comments) clutter the code and make the code harder to read.\\n\\nMy approach is to rely on unit tests and code reviews to make sure the usage of `any` are in check.\\n\\nAlso, defining the correct type is not always easy and can take significant amount of time.\\nIf you are working under a schedule, you might not have time to do that.\\n\\nAnother point to make is that since [TypeScript] is constantly improving,\\nif you build some complex types, it might work in one version and break in another version.\\n\\nASK ME HOW I KNOW IT.\\n\\nOf course, I\'m not saying allowing your code litters with `any` and call it a day.\\nYou should keep track on those usages and clean it up when you get a chance to.\\n\\nConverting `any` back to a proper type improves efficiency.\\nAs that is why we use [TypeScript].\\n\\nAnd you may discover some bugs along the way.\\n\\n[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/\\n[TypeScript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/\\n[TypeScript 4.7]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7-rc/\\n[note-on-soundness]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html#a-note-on-soundness\\n[example-soundness]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?strictFunctionTypes=false#example/soundness"}]}')}}]);
